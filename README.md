## Assignment Details:

### Tasks:
    Assignment 1: 
    
    1. Vector Plotting:
        -> Generate two vectors with 15 random float values each.
        -> Plot both vectors on the same graph with labeled axes and a title.

    2. Heatmap Visualization:
        -> Create a 4×4 matrix with random values.
        -> Visualize the matrix as a heatmap with proper row and column labels.

    3. Matrix Operations and Visualization:
        -> Generate two 4×4 matrices with random values.
        -> Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication(dot) on them.
        -> Visualize the results using bar plots and discuss the effects.
        
    Assignment 2: 
        
    4. Use numpy to create a 3×3 matrix of random integers between 1 and 50.  
        ->  Run the code twice
        -> With a fixed seed (`np.random.seed(10)`) to ensure reproducibility.  
        -> Without setting a seed, random values are allowed to change each time.  
        -> Observe and explain the differences in outputs.  (in a different cell as text)

## Concepts Covered:

### Assignment-1:
- NumPy for random data generation and matrix operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Understanding vector and matrix operations
- Interpreting heatmaps and bar plots for numerical analysis
  
### Assignment-2:
- NumPy Basics – Usage of NumPy, a fundamental package for numerical computing in Python.
- Random Number Generation – Creating random integers using np.random.randint().
- Matrix Creation – Generating a 3×3 matrix filled with random integers.
- Randomness Without a Fixed Seed – Understanding how NumPy produces different outputs each time when no seed is set.
  
## What I Learned:

### Assignment-1:
- How to work with NumPy arrays and perform basic mathematical operations.
- How to use Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective data visualization.
- The impact of mathematical operations on matrices and how to interpret their results visually.
- The importance of clear labeling in visualizations for better data interpretation.

### Assignment-2: 
- How to generate a matrix of random integers using NumPy.
- The effect of not setting a seed on randomness.
- The difference between reproducible and non-reproducible random number generation.
